# FRC 2023
 Official Master Code for FRC 2465 Kauaibots for the 2023 season.

# Things to Note:
- This project is UNFINISHED. Code is still being written, revised, and simplified. 
- New versions of the code will be published when deemed necessary. Major changes made in each version can be found
in the Version Control document attached to this repository.
- This is the official master copy of the Robot Code for the 2023 Season. For anyone on the programming team: If you
would like to make a change of the code, please submit your changes to me first to be applied to the code. 
- Some of the features in this project are unstable, experimental, or untested. If you plan on using this code as an 
example for another project, you do so at your own risk. (If you would like to know more, see the Robot Container
and look at the button mappings. Some of the commands are being mapped to buttons on an "experimental" joystick.)
- Some of the features in this project are unused. They will either be integrated into the code in upcoming versions
or will be removed from the code if needed.
- Date codes at the end of the project folder indicate the date the code was copied. To view the version number,
see the Version Control.md file and match the date code to the proper version number.
